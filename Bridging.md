# Bridging - Mantle Tech Docs

App developers and users commonly need to move data and assets between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2). We call the process of moving data and assets between the two networks "bridging".

`"Bridges work just like the bridges we know in the physical world. Just as a physical bridge connects two physical locations, a blockchain bridge connects two blockchain ecosystems. Bridges facilitate communication between blockchains through the transfer of information and assets.`

`Let's consider an example:`

`You're from the USA and are planning a trip to Europe. You have USD, but you need EUR to spend. To exchange your USD for EUR you can use a currency exchange for a small fee."`

Mantle (L2) is a separate blockchain system from Ethereum (L1). Similar to exchanging USD for EUR, we need a way to move **$ETH** and other tokens from Ethereum to Mantle so the blockchain system will recognize and accept it in a verifiable and secure way.

In order to move assets into or out of Mantle network you can use the Mantle Bridge.
