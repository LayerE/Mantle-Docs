.

###

Acquire Test $BIT and Goerli $ETH

[](#acquire-test-usdbit-and-goerli-usdeth)

To begin transacting on Mantle testnet, you must acquire Goerli **$ETH** and testnet **$BIT** and bridge it across.

You can obtain Goerli **$ETH** from the following faucets:

Alternatively, you can also acquire test **$BIT** on Goerli from our

[Discord server](https://discord.gg/0xmantle)

. Once you've joined the server, navigate to the **#faucet** channel and send the following message to receive your test **$BIT**.

$faucet \[your erc20 address on goerli\]

You can make a claim to any ERC-20 address every 4 hours

To move your **$BIT** tokens/Ether/other ERC-20 tokens between the Mantle and Ethereum chain, visit the

[Mantle Bridge](https://bridge.testnet.mantle.xyz/)

.

Once you're done adding Mantle to your wallet and have acquired some testnet tokens to experiment with, next in-line is to go ahead and check out the multitude of cool dApps that are part of our ecosystem. Check out

The current version of Mantle testnet does not support deploying verifier or MPC nodes to it

Our

[**Github**](https://github.com/mantlenetworkio/mantle)

is a good place to familiarize yourself with the Mantle tech stack and find tools and usage examples for reference that'll help you set up a local development environment, integrate our SDK, invoke node RPC endpoints, and more.

dApp developers can build on Mantle seamlessly using their favorite Ethereum tooling. You can find a selection of tutorials

[here](https://mantlenetworkio.github.io/mantle-tutorial/)

.

Mantle nodes support the Ethereum **JSON-RPC** API implementation with a few changes and additional custom methods. You can find more details on the [Mantle Node API](https://docs.mantle.xyz/tools-and-sdk/mantle-node-api) page.
